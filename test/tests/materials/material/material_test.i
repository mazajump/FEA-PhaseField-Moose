# This is a simple test of the Material System. A
# user-defined Material (MTMaterial) is providing a
# Real property named "matp" that varies spatially
# throughout the domain. This property is used as a
# coefficient by MatDiffusion. It is also output
# by MaterialRealAux for visualization purposes.
