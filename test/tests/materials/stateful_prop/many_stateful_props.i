# This test creates several unused stateful properties.
# It's here to make sure that we don't consume too much
# memory if we store them all. With 180x180 elements
# we were previously seeing nearly a Gigabyte of memory
# consumed using TBB's map. We are now using unordered
# map which saves us 6x to 8x on memory.
