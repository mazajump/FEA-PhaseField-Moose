# This model tests the MaxIncrement damper. The converged solution field
# u varies from 0 to 1 across the domain due to the BCs applied. A value
# for the maximum allowed increment to the solution vector for each
# NL iteration is specified. The more restrictive this value is, the
# larger the number of NL iterations will be. This test ensures that a
# minimum number of NL iterations are taken under those conditions.
