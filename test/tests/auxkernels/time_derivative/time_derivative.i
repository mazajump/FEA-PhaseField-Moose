# This test is setting the values of an auxiliary varaible f according to the
# function f_fn. This function is time dependent.
#
# Then the f_dot is brought as a forcing function into the L2 projection, thus
# the resulting values of u should give the f_dot which is known.
#
# NOTE: There is no need to do more than 2 time steps, because f_dot is constant
# in time. That means that the projection is exactly the same for the second time
# step as is for the first time step. The solver has nothing to do and you can
# see that on the "zero" initial non-linear residual.
