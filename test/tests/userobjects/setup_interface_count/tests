# The following tests are designed to count how often the setup methods are called (initialSetup, etc.),
# which requires that the threading be disabeled because the counts can differ.
#
# Also, GeneralUserObject must also be restricted for a certain MPI because their methods will be called
# on each processor, since they are not distributed in any fashion.
