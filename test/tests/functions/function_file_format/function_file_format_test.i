# This tests the capability of the code to read input files in csv or space separated format.
# There are four variables and four functions of the same name; a,b,c, and d.  The diffusion equation is "solved"
# for each of these variables with a boundary condition of type FunctionDirchletBC applied to a boundary
# (i.e. node set) that includes every node in the element, so the solution is the boundary condition defined by the function.
#  Each boundary condition uses a function of type PiecewiseLinear that gets its value from a file,
# which could be in comma separated or space separated format.  The input file can also contain comments.
#
# The files could have the form
# 0,1,2,3 # time
# 0,4,5,6 # bc value
# for format = row
# or
# 0,0
# 1,4
# 2,5
# 3,6
# for format = column
# Values in files could be separated by white space.  See the .csv and .dat files for format examples.
#
# The value of the variables should correspond to the function.
# At time = 0, the variable = 0, at time = 1, variable = 4 and so on.

  file = cube.e
  # This problem only has 1 element, so using DistributedMesh in parallel
  # isn't really an option, and we don't care that much about DistributedMesh
  # in serial.
