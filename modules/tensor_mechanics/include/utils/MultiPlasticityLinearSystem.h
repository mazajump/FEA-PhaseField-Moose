/**
 * MultiPlasticityLinearSystem computes the linear system
 * and handles linear-dependence removal
 * for use in FiniteStrainMultiPlasticity
 *
 * Note that if run in debug mode you might have to use
 * the --no-trap-fpe flag because PETSc-LAPACK-BLAS
 * explicitly compute 0/0 and 1/0, and this causes
 * Libmesh to trap the floating-point exceptions
 *
 * These routines are quite complicated, so here is an
 * extended explanation.
 *
 *
 * SURFACES AND MODELS
 *
 * Each plasticity model can have multiple surfaces
 * (eg, Mohr-Coulomb has 6 surfaces), and one internal
 * parameter.  This is also described in
 * MultiPlasticityRawComponentAssembler.  The
 *
 *
 * VARIABLE NAMES
 *
 * _num_surfaces = total number of surfaces
 * _num_models = total number of plasticity models
 * pm = plasticity multiplier.  pm.size() = _num_surfaces
 * intnl = internal variable.  intnl.size() = _num_models
 *
 *
 * DEGREES OF FREEDOM
 *
 * The degrees of freedom are:
 * the 6 components of stress (it is assumed to be symmetric)
 * the plasticity multipliers, pm.
 * the internal parameters, intnl.
 *
 * Note that in any single Newton-Raphson (NR) iteration, the number
 * of pm and intnl may be different from any other NR iteration.
 * This is because of deactivating surfaces because they
 * are deemed unimportant by the calling program (eg, their
 * yield function is < 0), or because their flow direction is
 * linearly dependent on other surfaces.  Therefore:
 *
 * - there are "not active" surfaces, and these *never enter*
 * any right-hand-side (RHS), or jacobian, residual, etc calculations.
 * It is as if they never existed.
 *
 * - there are "active" surfaces, and *all these* enter RHS,
 * jacobian, etc, calculations.  This set of active surfaces
 * may further decompose into "linearly independent" and "linearly
 * dependent" surfaces.  The latter are surfaces whose flow direction
 * is linearly dependent on the former.  Only the dofs from
 * "linearly independent" constraints are changed during the NR step.
 *
 * Hence, more exactly, the degrees of freedom, whose changes will be
 * provided in the NR step are:
 * the 6 components of stress (it is assumed to be symmetric)
 * the plasticity multipliers, pm, belonging to linearly independent surfaces
 * the internal parameters, intnl, belonging to models with at least one linearly-independent
 * surface
 *
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINTS AND RHS
 *
 * The variables calculated by calculateConstraints and
 * calculateRHS are:
 * epp = pm*r - E_inv*(trial_stress - stress) = pm*r - delta_dp
 * f = yield function    [all the active constraints, including the deactivated_due_to_ld.  The
 * latter ones will not be put into the linear system]
 * ic = intnl - intnl_old + pm*h   [only for models that contain active surfaces]
 *
 * Here pm*r = sum_{active_alpha} pm[alpha]*r[alpha].  Note that this contains all the "active"
 * surfaces,
 *             even the ones that have been deactivated_due_to_ld.  in calculateConstraints, etc, r
 * is a
 *             std::vector containing only all the active flow directions (including
 *             deactivated_due_to_ld, but not the "not active").
 * f = all the "active" surfaces, even the ones that have been deactivated_due_to_ld.  However, the
 *             latter are not put into the RHS
 * pm*h = sum_{active_alpha} pm[alpha]*h[alpha].  Note that this only contains the "active"
 *             hardening potentials, even the ones that have been deactivated_due_to_ld.
 *             In calculateConstraints, calculateRHS and calculateJacobian,
 *             h is a std::vector containing only these "active" ones.
 *             Hence, the sum_{active_alpha} contains deactivated_due_to_ld contributions.
 *             HOWEVER, if all the surfaces belonging to a model are either
 *             "not active" or deactivated_due_to_ld, then this ic is not included in the RHS
 *
 * The RHS is
 * rhs = -(epp(0,0), epp(1,0), epp(1,1), epp(2,0), epp(2,1), epp(2,2), f[0], f[1], ...,
 * f[_num_active_f], ic[0], ic[1], ..., ic[num_active_ic])
 * Notice the appearance of only the i>=j "epp" components.
 *
 *
 * THE JACOBIAN
 *
 * This is d(-rhs)/d(dof).  Remember that the dofs are dependent
 * on what is deactivated_due_to_ld, as specified above.
 * In matrix form, the Jacobian is:
 * ( depp_dstress   depp_dpm  depp_dintnl )
 * (  df_dstress       0      df_dintnl   )
 * ( dic_dstress    dic_dpm   dic_dintnl  )
 * For the "epp" terms, only the i>=j components are kept in the RHS, so only these terms are kept
 * here too
