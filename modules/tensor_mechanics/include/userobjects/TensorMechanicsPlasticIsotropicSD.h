 * IsotropicSD plasticity model from Yoon (2013)
 * the name of the paper is "Asymmetric yield function based on the
 * stress invariants for pressure sensitive metals" published
 * 4th December 2013.
 * This model accounts for sensitivity in pressure and for the
 * strength differential effect
 * Yield_function = \f$ a[b*I_{1} + (J2^{3/2} - c*J3)^{1/3}]\f$ - yield_strength
 * The last three functions are the main functions that call all other
 * functions in this module for the Newton-Raphson method.
