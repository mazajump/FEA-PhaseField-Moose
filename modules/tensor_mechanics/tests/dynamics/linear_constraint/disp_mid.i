# Constraining slave nodes to move a linear combination of master nodes
#
# The test consists of a 2D rectangular block divided into two Quad elements
# (along its height) which have different material properties.
# A displacement of 2 m is applied to the top surface of the block in x direction and the
# bottom surface is held fixed.
# The nodes of the interface between the two elements will tend to move as
# dictated by the material models of the two elements.

# LinearNodalConstraint forces the interface nodes to move as a linear combination
# of the nodes on the top and bottom of the block.
# master node ids and the corresponding weights are taken as input by the LinearNodalConstraint
# along with the slave node set or slave node ids.
# The constraint can be applied using either penalty or kinematic formulation.

# In this example, the final x displacement of the top surface is 2m and bottom surface is 0m.
# Therefore, the final x displacement of the interface nodes would be 0.25*top+0.75*bottom = 0.5m
