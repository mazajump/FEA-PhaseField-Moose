# UserObject J2 test, with hardening, but with rate=1E6
# apply uniform compression in x direction to give
# trial stress_xx = 5, so sqrt(3*J2) = 5
# with zero Poisson's ratio, lambda_mu = 1E6, and strength=2, strength_residual=1,
# the equations that we need to solve are:
#
# stress_yy = stress_zz  [because of the symmetry of the problem: to keep Lode angle constant]
# stress_xx - stress_yy = 1 + (2 - 1)*exp(-0.5*(1E6*q)^2)   [yield_fcn = 0]
# stress_xx + stress_yy + stress_zz = 5   [mean stress constant]
# q = gamma
# stress_xx = 1E6*2*gamma*(stress_xx - 5/3)*sqrt(3)/2/sqrt(J2), where sqrt(J2) = (1 + (2 - 1)*exp(-0.5*(1E6*q)^2))/Sqrt(3)
# so RHS = 1E6*2*gamma*(stress_xx - 5/3)*3/2/(stress_xx - stress_yy)
#
# stress_xx = 2.672
# stress_yy = 1.164
# q = 1.164E-6
