# apply compression in x, y and z directions such that strain = diag(-1E-6, -2E-6, 3E-6).
# With lame_lambda=0 and lame_mu=1E7, this gives
# trial_Stress = diag(-20, -40, -60), so trial_mean_Stress = -40.
# with a = -1 and strength = 30, the algorithm should return to
# stress = diag(-10, -30, -50)
