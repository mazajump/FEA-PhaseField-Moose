# This simulation models the mechanics solution for a hollow sphere under
# pressure, applied on the outer surfaces, using 1D spherical symmetry
# assumpitions.  The inner radius of the sphere, r = 4mm, is pinned to prevent
# rigid body movement of the sphere.
#
# From Bower (Applied Mechanics of Solids, 2008, available online at
# solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter4_1/Chapter4_1.htm), and applying the outer
# pressure and pinned displacement boundary conditions set in this simulation,
# the radial displacement is given by:
#
# u(r) = \frac{P(1 + v)(1 - 2v)b^3}{E(b^3(1 + v) + 2a^3(1-2v))} * (\frac{a^3}{r^2} - r)
#
# where P is the applied pressure, b is the outer radius, a is the inner radius,
# v is Poisson's ration, E is Young's Modulus, and r is the radial position.
#
# The radial stress is given by:
#
# S(r) = \frac{Pb^3}{b^3(1 + v) + 2a^3(1 - 2v)} * (\frac{2a^3}{r^3}(2v - 1) - (1 + v))
#
# The test assumes an inner radius of 4mm, and outer radius of 9 mm,
# zero displacement at r = 4mm, and an applied outer pressure of 2MPa.
# The radial stress is largest in the inner most element and, at an assumed
# mid element coordinate of 4.5mm, is equal to -2.545MPa.
