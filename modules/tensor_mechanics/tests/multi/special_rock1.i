# Plasticity models:
# Mohr-Coulomb with cohesion = 40MPa, friction angle = 35deg, dilation angle = 5deg
# Tensile with strength = 1MPa
#
# Lame lambda = 1GPa.  Lame mu = 1.3GPa
#
# A line of elements is perturbed randomly, and return to the yield surface at each quadpoint is checked
#
# NOTE: The yield function tolerances here are set at 100-times what i would usually use
# This is because otherwise the test fails on the 'pearcey' architecture.
# This is because identical stress tensors yield slightly different eigenvalues
# (and hence return-map residuals) on 'pearcey' than elsewhere, which results in
# a different number of NR iterations are needed to return to the yield surface.
# This is presumably because of compiler internals, or the BLAS routines being
# optimised differently or something similar.
