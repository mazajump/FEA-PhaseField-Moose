# This runs the models mentioned in the first example of the Multi-Surface paper
#
# Plasticity models:
# SimpleTester with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 1E9  (only does elasticity)
# SimpleTester with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 0
# SimpleTester with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 1E-3
#
# Lame lambda = 0 (Poisson=0).  Lame mu = 0.5E6
#
# A line of elements is perturbed randomly, and return to the yield surface at each quadpoint is checked
