# Plasticit models:
# SimpleTester with a = 0 and b = 1 and strength = 1
# SimpleTester with a = 1 and b = 1 and strength = 2
#
# Lame lambda = 0 (Poisson=0).  Lame mu = 0.5E6
#
# A single element is stretched by 4.0E-6m in y directions and 2.0E-6 in z direction.
# trial stress_zz = 2 and stress_yy = 4
#
# Then both  SimpleTesters should activate initially and return to the "corner" point
# (stress_zz = 1 = stress_yy), but then the plastic multiplier for SimpleTester1 will
# be negative, and so it will be deactivated, and the algorithm will return to
# stress_zz = 0, stress_yy = 2
# internal1 should be zero, internal2 should be 2
