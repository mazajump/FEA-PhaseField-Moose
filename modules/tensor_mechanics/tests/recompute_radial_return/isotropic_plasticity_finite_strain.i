# This simulation uses the piece-wise linear strain hardening model
# with the incremental small strain formulation; incremental small strain
# is required to produce the strain_increment for the DiscreteRadialReturnStressIncrement
# class, which handles the calculation of the stress increment to return
# to the yield surface in a J2 (isotropic) plasticity problem.
#
#  This test assumes a Poissons ratio of 0.3 and applies a displacement loading
# condition on the top in the y direction.
#
# An identical problem was run in Abaqus on a similar 1 element mesh and was used
# to verify the SolidMechanics solution; this TensorMechanics code matches the
# SolidMechanics solution.
#
# Mechanical strain is the sum of the elastic and plastic strains but is different
# from total strain in cases with eigen strains, e.g. thermal strain.
