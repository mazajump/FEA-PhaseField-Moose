# Part of the bottom (minimum z) is pulled down by a Preset displacement
# This causes tensile failure in the elements immediately above.
# Because only the bottom row of elements ever fail, and because these
# fail in the first nonlinear step, Moose correctly converges in
# 1 nonlinear step, despite this problem being inelastic.
# (If the problem had lower cohesion, then the top row would also
# fail, but in the second nonlinear step, and so the simulation
# would require at least two nonlinear steps.)
