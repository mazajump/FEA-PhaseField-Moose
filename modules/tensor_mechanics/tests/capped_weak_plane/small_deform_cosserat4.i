# Plastic deformation.  Layered Cosserat with parameters:
# Young = 10.0
# Poisson = 0.25
# layer_thickness = 10
# joint_normal_stiffness = 2.5
# joint_shear_stiffness = 2.0
# These give the following nonzero components of the elasticity tensor:
# E_0000 = E_1111 = 1.156756756757E+01
# E_0011 = E_1100 = 3.855855855856E+00
# E_2222 = E_pp = 8.108108108108E+00
# E_0022 = E_1122 = E_2200 = E_2211 = 2.702702702703E+00
# G = E_0101 = E_0110 = E_1001 = E_1010 = 4
# Gt = E_qq = E_0202 = E_0220 = E_2002 = E_1212 = E_1221 = E_2112 = 3.333333333333E+00
# E_2020 = E_2121 = 3.666666666667E+00
# They give the following nonzero components of the bending rigidity tensor:
# D = 8.888888888889E+02
# B_0101 = B_1010 = 8.080808080808E+00
# B_0110 = B_1001 = -2.020202020202E+00
#
# Applying the following deformation to the zmax surface of a unit cube:
# disp_x = 32*t/Gt
# disp_y = 24*t/Gt
# disp_z = 10*t/E_2222
# but leaving wc_x and wc_y unfixed
# yields the following strains:
# strain_xz = 32*t/Gt - wc_y = 9.6*t - wc_y
# strain_zx = wc_y
# strain_yz = 24*t/Gt + wc_x = 7.2*t + wc_x
# strain_zy = - wc_x
# strain_zz = 10*t/E_2222 = 1.23333333*t
# and all other components, and the curvature, are zero (assuming
# wc is uniform over the cube).
#
# When wc=0, the nonzero components of stress are therefore:
# stress_xx = stress_yy = 3.33333*t
# stress_xz = stress_zx = 32*t
# stress_yz = stress_zy = 24*t
# stress_zz = 10*t
# The moment stress is zero.
# So q = 40*t and p = 10*t
#
# Use tan(friction_angle) = 0.5 and tan(dilation_angle) = E_qq/Epp/2, and cohesion=20,
# the system should return to p=0, q=20, ie stress_zz=0, stress_xz=16,
# stress_yz=12 on the first time step (t=1)
# and
# stress_xx = stress_yy = 0
# and
# stress_zx = 32, and stress_zy = 24.
# This has resulted in a non-symmetric stress tensor, and there is
# zero moment stress, so the system is not in equilibrium.  A
# nonzero wc must therefore be generated.
#
# The obvious choice of wc is such that stress_zx = 16 and
# stress_zy = 12, because then the final returned stress will
# be symmetric.  This gives
# wc_y = - 48
# wc_x = 36
# At t=1, the nonzero components of stress are
# stress_xx = stress_yy = 3.33333
# stress_xz = 32, stress_zx = 16
# stress_yz = 24, stress_zy = 12
# stress_zz = 10*t
# The moment stress is zero.
#
# The returned stress is
# stress_xx = stress_yy = 0
# stress_xz = stress_zx = 16
# stress_yz = stress_zy = 12
# stress_zz = 0
# The total strains are given above.
# Since q returned from 40 to 20, plastic_strain_xz = 9.6/2 = 4.8
# and plastic_strain_yz = 7.2/2 = 3.6.
# Since p returned to zero, all of the total strain_zz is
# plastic, ie plastic_strain_zz = 1.23333
