# apply uniform stretches in x, y and z directions.
# let cohesion = 10, cohesion_residual = 2, cohesion_limit = 0.0003
# With cohesion = C, friction_angle = 60deg, tip_smoother = 4, the
# algorithm should return to
# sigma_m = (C*Cos(60) - 4)/Sin(60)
# This allows checking of the relationship for C
