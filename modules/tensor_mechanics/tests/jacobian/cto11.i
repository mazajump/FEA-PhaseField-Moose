# checking jacobian for 3-plane linear plasticity using SimpleTester.
#
# This is like the test multi/eight_surface14.i
# Plasticity models:
# SimpleTester0 with a = 0 and b = 1 and strength = 1
# SimpleTester1 with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 1
# SimpleTester2 with a = 1 and b = 1 and strength = 3
# SimpleTester3 with a = 0 and b = 1 and strength = 1.1
# SimpleTester4 with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 1.1
# SimpleTester5 with a = 1 and b = 1 and strength = 3.1
# SimpleTester6 with a = 1 and b = 2 and strength = 3.1
# SimpleTester7 with a = 2 and b = 1 and strength = 3.1
#
# Lame lambda = 0 (Poisson=0).  Lame mu = 0.5E6
#
# A single element is stretched by 2.1E-6m in y direction and 3E-6 in z direction.
# trial stress_yy = 2.1 and stress_zz = 3.0
#
# This is similar to three_surface14.i, and a description is found there.
# The result should be stress_zz=1=stress_yy, with internal0=2
# and internal1=1.1
