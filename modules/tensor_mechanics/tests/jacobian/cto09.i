# checking jacobian for 3-plane linear plasticity using SimpleTester.
#
# This is like the test multi/three_surface14.i
# Plasticity models:
# SimpleTester0 with a = 0 and b = 1 and strength = 1
# SimpleTester1 with a = 1 and b = 0 and strength = 1
# SimpleTester2 with a = 1 and b = 1 and strength = 3
#
# Lame lambda = 0 (Poisson=0).  Lame mu = 0.5E6
#
# trial stress_yy = 0.15 and stress_zz = 1.5
#
# trial stress_yy = 2.1 and stress_zz = 3.0
#
# Then all three will be active, but there is linear-dependence.
# SimpleTester1 will turn off, since it is closest,
# and the algorithm will return to stress_zz=1, stress_yy=2, but
# then SimpleTester1 will be positive, so it will be turned back
# on, and then SimpleTester0 or SimpleTester2 will be turned off
# (a random choice will be made).
# If SimpleTester2 is turned
# off then algorithm returns to stress_zz=1=stress_yy, but then
# SimpleTester2 violates Kuhn-Tucker (f<0 and pm>0), so the algorithm
# will restart, and return to stress_zz=1=stress_yy, with internal0=2
# and internal1=1.1
# If SimpleTester0 is turned off then the algorithm will return to
# stress_zz=2, stress_yy=1, where f0>0.  Once again, a random choice
# of turning off SimpleTester1 or SimpleTester2 can be made.  Hence,
# oscillations can occur.  If too many oscillations occur then the algorithm
# will fail
