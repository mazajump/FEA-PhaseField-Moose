# Beam bending.
# Displacements are applied to a beam and stresses and moment-stresses
# are measured.  Note that since these quantities are averaged over
# elements, to get a good agreement with the analytical solution the
# number of elements (nz) should be increased.  Using nx=10
# and nz=10 yields roughly 1% error.
# The displacements applied are a pure-bend around the y axis
# with an additional displacement in the y direction so that
# the result (below) will end up being plane stress (stress_yy=0):
# u_x = Axz
# u_y = Dzy
# u_z = -(A/2)x^2 + (D/2)(z^2-y^2)
# wc_x = -Dy
# wc_y = Ax
# wc_z = 0
# Here A and D are arbitrary constants.
# This results in strains being symmetric, and the only
# nonzero ones are
# ep_xx = Az
# ep_yy = Dz
# ep_zz = Dz
# kappa_xy = -D
# kappa_yx = A
# Then choosing D = -poisson*A gives, for layered Cosserat:
# stress_xx = EAz
# m_yx = (1-poisson^2)*A*B = (1/12)EAh^2 (last equality for joint_shear_stiffness=0)
# where h is the layer thickness.  All other stress and moment-stress
# components are zero.
# The test uses: E=1.2, poisson=0.3, A=1.11E-2, h=2
