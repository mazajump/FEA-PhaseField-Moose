# Beam bending.
# One end is clamped and the other end is subjected to a stress
# and micromechanical moment that will induce bending.
# The stress that will induce bending around the y axis is
# stress_xx = EAz
# This implies a micromechanical moment-stress of
# m_yx = (1/12)EAh^2 for joint_shear_stiffness=0.
# For joint_shear_stiffness!=0, the micromechanical moment-stress
# is
# m_yx = (1/12)EAa^2 G/(ak_s + G)
# All other stresses and moment stresses are assumed to be zero.
# With joint_shear_stiffness=0, and introducing D=-poisson*A, the
# nonzero strains are
# ep_xx = Az
# ep_yy = Dz
# ep_zz = Dz
# kappa_xy = -D
# kappa_yx = A
# This means the displacements are:
# u_x = Axz
# u_y = Dzy
# u_z = -(A/2)x^2 + (D/2)(z^2-y^2)
# wc_x = -Dy
# wc_y = Ax
# wc_z = 0
# This is bending of a bar around the y axis, in plane stress
# (stress_yy=0).  Displacements at the left-hand (x=0) are applied
# according to the above formulae; wc_x and wc_y are applied throughout
# the bar; and stress_xx is applied at the right-hand end (x=10).
# The displacements are measured and
# compared with the above formulae.
# The test uses: E=1.2, poisson=0.3, A=1.11E-2, h=2, ks=0.1, so
# stress_xx = 1.332E-2*z
# m_yx = 0.2379E-2
