This example shows a process of dendritic crystal growth, which is an anisotropic
nucleation process. This is a simple phase field model, in which one component
melt growth is presented in 2D condition.
The PDE in this process is:

  dw/dt = L*eps*deps*grad[F(w)] + L*grad*eps*eps*grad(w) + L*w(1-w)(w-0.5+m)
  dT/dt = grad^2(T) + K*dw/dt
  F(w) = (-dw/dy, dw/dx)
  L = 3333.33
  K = -1.8

w is the phase field parameter, which equals to 0 when it is liquid and 1 when
it is solid. T is the dimensionless temperature, for the melting temperature, it
equals to 1.
The parameter in PDE can be expressed as:

  eps = 0.01*[1+0.02*cos(4*angle)]

angle is the angle between grad(w) and x axis

  deps = d(eps)/d(angle)
  m = 0.9/3.14 * tan[10(1-T)]

The residual can be expressed as:

  R1 =   <dw/dt, _test> + <L*eps*deps*F(w), grad_test>
       + <L*eps*eps*grad(w), grad_test> -<L*w(1-w)(w-0.5+m), _test>

These four terms of residual correspond to TimeDerivative, ACInterfaceKobayashi1,
ACInterfaceKobayashi2, and ACParsed in Kernels respectively.

  R2 = <dT/dt, _test> + <grad(T), grad_test> - <K*dw/dt, _test>

These three terms of residual correspond to TimeDerivative, Diffusion, and
CoefCoupledTimeDerivative in Kernels respectively.
