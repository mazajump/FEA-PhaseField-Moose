The `MortarPeriodicMesh` is an object that augments the [GeneratedMesh](GeneratedMesh.md) class by adding
lower dimensional mortar interface meshes along selected sides of the simulation cell.
It can be used together with the [MortarPeriodicity](../Modules/PhaseField/MortarPeriodicity/Overview.moose) action
to set up gradient periodicity.
