/**
 * Density of a gas according to the van der Waals expression
 * (P + n^2 a/V^2)(V - nb) = nRT
 * How density is calculated: given P, (1/V) is calculated for n=1
 * and rho = molar_mass*(1/V).
 * The density is actually modified from this rho in the following ways:
 *  (1) density = rho - rho(P=0).  This is so that density(P=0)=0, which is
 *      physically correct, but the wan der Waals expression does not hold
 *      close to a vacuum.  However, it can be vital that density(P=0)=0
 *      numerically, otherwise fluid can be withdrawn from a node where there
 *      shouldn't be any fluid at P=0.  This is a miniscule correction, of
 *      many orders of magnitude below the precision of a, b, R or T
 *  (2) For P<0 we enter an unphysical region, but this may be sampled
 *      by the Newton process as the algorithm iterates towards the solution.
 *      Therefore i set density = infinity_ratio*molar_mass*(exp(-c*P) - 1) in this region
 *      where c is chosen so the derivatives match at P=0
