/**
 * This is a fully upwinded flux Kernel
 * The Variable of this Kernel should be the saturation
 *
 * The residual for the kernel is the darcy flux.
 * This is
 * R_i = int{mobility*flux_no_mob} = int{mobility*grad(pot)*permeability*grad(test_i)}
 * for node i.  where int is the integral over the element, and
 * pot = Porepressure - density*gravity.x
 *
 * However, in fully-upwind, the first step is to take the mobility outside the
 * integral.
 * R_i = mobility*int{flux_no_mob} = mobility*F_i
 * NOTE: R_i is exactly the mass flux flowing out of node i.
 * Similarly, F_i is a measure of fluid flowing out of node i.
 *
 * This leads to the definition of upwinding:
 *
 *   If F_i is positive then R_i = mobility_i * F_i
 *   That is, we use the upwind value of mobility.
 *
 * For the F_i<0 nodes we construct their R_i using mass conservation
