# Simple reaction-diffusion example to illustrate the use of the SolidKineticReactions
# action.
# In this example, two primary species a and b diffuse towards each other from
# opposite ends of a porous medium, reacting when they meet to form a mineral
# precipitate. The kinetic reaction is specified in the SolidKineticReactions block as:
#
# kin_reactions = '(1.0)a+(1.0)b=mineral'
#
# where a and b are the primary species (reactants), mineral is the precipitate,
# and the values in the parentheses are the stoichiometric coefficients for each
# species in the kinetic reaction.
#
# The SolidKineticReactions action creates all the required kernels and auxkernels
# to compute the reaction given by the above kinetic reaction equation.
#
# Specifically, it adds to following:
# * An AuxVariable named 'mineral' (given in the RHS of the kinetic reaction)
# * A KineticDisPreConcAux AuxKernel for this AuxVariable with all parameters
# * A CoupledBEKinetic Kernel for each primary species with all parameters
