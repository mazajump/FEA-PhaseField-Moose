# Simple equilibrium reaction example to illustrate the use of the AqueousEquilibriumReactions
# action.
# In this example, two primary species a and b are transported by diffusion and convection
# from the left of the porous medium, reacting to form two equilibrium species pa2 and pab
# according to the equilibrium reaction specified in the AqueousEquilibriumReactions block as:
#
#      reactions = '2a = pa2     2
#                   a + b = pab -2'
#
# where the 2 is the weight of the equilibrium species, the 2 on the RHS of the first reaction
# refers to the equilibrium constant (log10(Keq) = 2), and the -2 on the RHS of the second
# reaction equates to log10(Keq) = -2.
#
# The AqueousEquilibriumReactions action creates all the required kernels and auxkernels
# to compute the reaction given by the above equilibrium reaction equation.
#
# Specifically, it adds to following:
# * An AuxVariable named 'pa2' (given in the reactions equations)
# * An AuxVariable named 'pab' (given in the reactions equations)
# * A AqueousEquilibriumRxnAux AuxKernel for each AuxVariable with all parameters
# * A CoupledBEEquilibriumSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters
# * A CoupledDiffusionReactionSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters
# * A CoupledConvectionReactionSub Kernel for each primary species with all parameters if
# pressure is a coupled variable
