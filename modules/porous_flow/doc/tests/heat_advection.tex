\chapter{One-dimensional heat advection via a single-phase fluid}

Consider the case of a single-phase fluid in 1 dimension, $0\leq x
\leq 1$, with the porepressure fixed at the boundaries:
\begin{equation}
P(x=0, t) = 1 \ \ \ \mbox{and}\ \ \ P(x=1, t) = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
With zero gravity, and high fluid bulk modulus, the Darcy equation
implies that the solution is $P(x, t) = 1 - x$, with
\begin{equation}
v = k/\mu
\end{equation}
being the constant\footnote{To get the velocity of the individual
  fluid particles, this should be divided by the porosity.} ``Darcy
velocity'' from $x=0$ to $x=1$.  Here $k$ is the porous medium's
permeability, and $\mu$ is the fluid dynamic viscosity.

Suppose that the fluid internal energy is given by $CT$, where $C$ is
the specific heat capacity and $T$ is its temperature.  Assuming that
$P/\rho \ll CT$, then the fluid's enthalpy is also $CT$.  In this
case, the energy equation reads
\begin{equation}
\left((1 - \phi)\rho_{R}C_{R} + \phi\rho C \right) \frac{\partial
  T}{\partial t} + C \rho v \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
This is the wave equation with velocity
\begin{equation}
v_{T} = \frac{C\rho v}{(1 - \phi)\rho_{R}C_{R} + \phi\rho C} \ .
\end{equation}
Recall that the ``Darcy velocity'' is $v=k/\mu$.

Let the initial condition for $T$ be $T(x, t=0) = 200$.  Apply the
boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
T(x=0, t) = 300 \ \ \ \mbox{and} \ \ \ T(x=1, t) = 200 \ .
\end{equation}
At $t=0$ this creates a front at $x=0$.  Choose the parameters $C=2$,
$C_{R}=1$, $\rho=1000$, $\rho_{R}=125$, $\phi=0.2$, $k=1.1$, $\mu=4.4$
(all in consistent units), so that $v_{T}=1$ is the front's velocity.

The sharp front is {\em not} maintained by
MOOSE.  This is due to numerical diffusion, which is particularly
strong in the upwinding scheme implemented in the PorousFlow module.
Nevertheless, MOOSE advects the smooth front with the correct
velocity, as shown in Figure~\ref{heat_advection_1d.fig}.

The sharp front is {\em not} maintained by MOOSE even when no
upwinding is used.  In the case at hand, which uses a fully-saturated
single-phase fluid, the {\tt FullySaturated} versions of the Kernels
may be used in order to compare with the standard fully-upwinded
Kernels.  The {\tt FullySaturated} Kernels do not employ any upwinding
whatsoever, so less numerical
diffusion is expected.  This is demonstrated in
Figure~\ref{heat_advection_1d.fig}.  Two additional points may also be
nocied: (1) the lack of upwinding has produced a ``bump'' in the
temperature profile near the hotter side; (2) the lack of upwinding
means the temperature profile moves slightly slower than it should.
These two affects reduce as the mesh density is increased, however.

\caption{Results of heat advection via a fluid in 1D.  The fluid flows
  with constant Darcy velocity of $0.25$\,m.s$^{-1}$ to the right, and
  this advects a temperature front at velocity $1$\,m.s$^{-1}$ to the
  right.  The pictures above that the numerical implementation of
  porous flow within MOOSE (including upwinding) diffuses sharp
  fronts, but advects them at the correct velocity (notice the centre
  of the upwinded front is at the correct position in each picture).
  Less diffusion is experienced without upwinding.  Left: temperature
  $t=0.1$\,s.  Right: temperature at $t=0.6$\,s.}
