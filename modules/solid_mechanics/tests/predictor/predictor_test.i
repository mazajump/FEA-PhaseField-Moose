# The purpose of this test is to test the simple predictor.  This is a very
# small, monotonically loaded block of material.  If things are working right,
# the predictor should come very close to exactly nailing the solution on steps
# after the first step.  Because of nonlinear geometry, the predictor is slightly
# off in general, but that is mitigated by setting this up so that the elements
# undergo no rotations.

# The main thing to check here is that once the predictor kicks in, there are
# no iterations required.
