#
# Test to exercise the exponential stress release
#
# Stress vs. strain should show a linear relationship until cracking,
#   an exponential stress release, a linear relationship back to zero
#   strain, a linear relationship with the original stiffness in
#   compression and then back to zero strain, a linear relationship
#   back to the exponential curve, and finally further exponential
#   stress release.
