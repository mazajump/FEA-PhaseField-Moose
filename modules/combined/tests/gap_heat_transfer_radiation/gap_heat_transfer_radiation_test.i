# 1-D Gap Heat Transfer Test without mechanics
#
# This test exercises 1-D gap heat transfer for a helium-filled gap including radiation.
#
# The mesh consists of two element blocks containing one element each.  Each
#   element is a unit cube.  They sit next to one another with a unit between them.
#
# The conductivity of both blocks is set very large to achieve a uniform temperature
#  across each block. The temperature of the far left boundary
#  is ramped from 100 to 200 over one time unit, and then held fixed for an additional
#  time unit.  The temperature of the far right boundary is held fixed at 100.
#
# A simple analytical solution is possible for the heat flux between the blocks:
#
#  Flux = (T_left - T_right) * h_gap
#
#    where  h_gap = h_gas + h_cont + h_rad
#
# By setting the contact pressure, roughnesses, and jump distances to zero, the gap
#   conductance simplifies to:
#
#    h_gap = gapK/d_gap + sigma*Fe*(T_left^2 + T_right^2)*(T_left + T_right)
#
#      where Fe = 1/(1/eps_left + 1/eps_right - 1)
#            eps = emissivity
#
# For pure helium, BISON computes the gas conductivity as:
#
#  gapK(Tavg) = 2.639e-3*Tavg^0.7085
#
# For the test, the final (t=2) average gas temperature is (200 +100)/2 = 150,
#  giving gapK(150) = 0.09187557
#
# Assuming ems_left = ems_right = 0.5, Fe = 1/3
#
# The heat flux across the gap at that time is then:
#
#  Flux(2) = 100 * ((0.09187557/1.0) + (5.669e-8/3)*(200^2 + 100^2)*(200 + 100))
#          = 37.532557
#
# The flux post processors give 37.53255
