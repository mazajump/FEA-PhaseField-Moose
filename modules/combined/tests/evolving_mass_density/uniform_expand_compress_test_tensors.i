#  Element mass tests

#  This series of tests is designed to compute the mass of elements based on
#  an evolving mass density calculation.  The tests consist of expansion and compression
#  of the elastic patch test model along each axis, uniform expansion and compression,
#  and shear in each direction.  The expansion and compression tests change the volume of
#  the elements.  The corresponding change in density should compensate for this so the
#  mass remains constant.  The shear tests should not result in a volume change, and this
#  is checked too.  The mass calculation is done with the post processor called Mass.

#  The tests/file names are as follows:

#  Expansion and compression along a single axis
#  expand_compress_x_test_out.e
#  expand_compress_y_test_out.e
#  expand_compress_z_test_out.e

#  Volumetric expansion and compression
#  uniform_expand_compress_test.i

#  Zero volume change shear along each axis
#  shear_x_test_out.e
#  shear_y_test_out.e
#  shear_z_test_out.e

#  The resulting mass calculation for these tests should always be = 1.

# This test is a duplicate of the uniform_expand_compress_test.i test for solid mechanics, and the
#   output of this tensor mechanics test is compared to the original
#   solid mechanics output.  The duplication is necessary to test the
#   migrated tensor mechanics version while maintaining tests for solid mechanics.
