# Considers the mechanics solution for a thick spherical shell that is uniformly
# pressurized on the inner and outer surfaces. Three versions of the test are
# provided, assuming 1D spherical geometry (1D-SPH), 2D axisymmetic geometry
# (2D-RZ), and 3D geometry (3D). The tests demonstrate that all three geometric
# approaches produce the same correct solution.
#
# From Roark (Formulas for Stress and Strain, McGraw-Hill, 1975), the radially-dependent
# circumferential stress in a uniformly pressurized thick spherical shell is given by:
#
# S(r) = [ Pi[ri^3(2r^3+ro^3)] - Po[ro^3(2r^3+ri^3)] ] / [2r^3(ro^3-ri^3)]
#
#   where:
#          Pi = inner pressure
#          Po = outer pressure
#          ri = inner radius
#          ro = outer radius
#
# The tests assume an inner and outer radii of 5 and 10, with internal and external
# pressures of 100000 and 200000, respectively. The resulting compressive tangential
# stress is largest at the inner wall and, from the above equation, has a value
# of -271429.
#
# RESULTS are below. Since stresses are average element values, values for the
# edge element and one-element-in are used to extrapolate the stress to the
# inner surface. The vesrion of the tests that are checked use the coarsest meshes.
