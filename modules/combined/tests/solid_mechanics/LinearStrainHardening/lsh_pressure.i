#
# This test exercises the linear strain hardening material.  The mesh is
# taken from the patch test (7 elements, 1 on the interior).  There are
# symmetry bcs on three faces with a pressure load on another face.
#
# Young's modulus    = 2.4e5
# Yield stress       = 2.4e2
# Hardening constant = 1600
#
# The pressure reaches 2.4e2 at time 1 and 2.6e2 at time 2.  Thus, at
# time 1, the stress is at the yield stress.  2.4e2/2.4e5=0.001 (the
# strain at time 1).  The increase in stress from time 1 to time 2 is
# 20.  20/1600=0.0125 (the plastic strain).  The elastic strain at
# time 2 is 260/2.4e5=0.00108333.  The total strain at time 2 is
# 0.01358333.
