# 2DRZ Spherical Gap Heat Transfer Test.
#
# This test exercises 2D gap heat transfer for a constant conductivity gap.
#
# The mesh consists of an inner solid sphere of radius = 1 unit, and outer
# hollow sphere with an inner radius of 2. In other words, the gap between
# them is 1 radial unit in length.
#
# The conductivity of both spheres is set very large to achieve a uniform
# temperature in each sphere. The temperature of the center node of the
# inner sphere is ramped from 100 to 200 over one time unit. The
# temperature of the outside of the outer, hollow sphere is held fixed
# at 100.
#
# A simple analytical solution is possible for the integrated heat flux
# between the inner and outer spheres:
#
#  Integrated Flux = (T_left - T_right) * (gapK/(r^2*((1/r1)-(1/r2)))) * Area
#
# For gapK = 1 (default value)
#
# The area is taken as the area of the slave (inner) surface:
#
# Area = 4 * pi * 1^2 (4*pi*r^2)
#
# The integrated heat flux across the gap at time 1 is then:
#
# 4*pi*k*delta_T/((1/r1)-(1/r2))
# 4*pi*1*100/((1/1) - (1/2)) =  2513.3 watts
#
# For comparison, see results from the integrated flux post processors.
# This simulation makes use of symmetry, so only 1/2 of the spheres is meshed
# As such, the integrated flux from the post processors is 1/2 of the total,
# or 1256.6 watts... i.e. 400*pi.
# The value coming from the post processor is slightly less than this
# but converges as mesh refinement increases.
#
# Simulating contact is challenging. Regression tests that exercise
# contact features can be difficult to solve consistently across multiple
# platforms. While designing these tests, we felt it worth while to note
# some aspects of these tests. The following applies to:
# sphere3D.i, sphere2DRZ.i, cyl2D.i, and cyl3D.i.
# 1. We decided that to perform consistently across multiple platforms we
# would use very small convergence tolerance. In this test we chose an
# nl_rel_tol of 1e-12.
# 2. Due to such a high value for thermal conductivity (used here so that the
# domains come to a uniform temperature) the integrated flux at time = 0
# was relatively large (the value coming from SideIntegralFlux =
#  -_diffusion_coef[_qp]*_grad_u[_qp]*_normals[_qp] where the diffusion coefficient
# here is thermal conductivity).
# Even though _grad_u[_qp] is small, in this case the diffusion coefficient
# is large. The result is a number that isn't exactly zero and tends to
# fail exodiff. For this reason the parameter execute_on = initial should not
# be used. That parameter is left to default settings in these regression tests.
