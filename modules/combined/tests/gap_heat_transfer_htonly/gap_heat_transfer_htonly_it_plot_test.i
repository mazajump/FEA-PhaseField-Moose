# 1-D Gap Heat Transfer Test without mechanics
#
# This test exercises 1-D gap heat transfer for a constant conductivity gap.
#
# The mesh consists of two element blocks containing one element each.  Each
#   element is a unit cube.  They sit next to one another with a unit between them.
#
# The conductivity of both blocks is set very large to achieve a uniform temperature
#  across each block. The temperature of the far left boundary
#  is ramped from 100 to 200 over one time unit, and then held fixed for an additional
#  time unit.  The temperature of the far right boundary is held fixed at 100.
#
# A simple analytical solution is possible for the heat flux between the blocks:
#
#  Flux = (T_left - T_right) * (gapK/gap_width)
#
# The gap conductivity is specified as 1, thus
#
#  gapK(Tavg) = 1.0*Tavg
#
#
# The heat flux across the gap at time = 2 is then:
#
#  Flux(2) = 100 * (1.0/1.0) = 100
#
# For comparison, see results from the flux post processors
