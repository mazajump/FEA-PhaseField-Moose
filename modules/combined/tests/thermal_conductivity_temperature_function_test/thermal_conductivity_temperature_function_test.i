#
# This test evaluates the capability of HeatConductionMaterial to define
# thermal conductivity as a function of temperature.  The test uses the patch test
# cube mesh with a flux bc on one side and a temperature bc on the opposite side.
# The temperature bc changes as a function of time from 100 to 200.  The thermal
# conductivity is a function of temperature, with k = 1 for temps = 100-199, k = 2
# for temps _>_ 200. The flux, q = 10 is constant.  The Transient Executioner is used here
# although the interial kernel is omitted, so this is really a series of two steady-state
# solutions.
