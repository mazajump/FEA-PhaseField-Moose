# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This test is designed to verify the ComputeVariableElasticConstantStress
# by varying the young's modulus with temperature. A constant strain is applied
# to the mesh in this case, and the stress varies with the changing elastic constants.
#
# Geometry: A single element cube in symmetry boundary conditions and pulled
#           at a constant displacement to create a constant strain in the x-direction.
#
# Temperature:  The temperature varies from 400K to 700K in this simulation by
#           100K each time step. The temperature is held constant in the last
#           timestep to ensure that the elasticity tensor components are constant
#           under constant temperature.
#
# Results: Because Poisson's ratio is set to zero, only the stress along the x
#          axis is non-zero.  The stress changes with temperature.
#

#          500              0.001             10.0e6               1.0e4
#          600              0.001              9.94e6              9.94e3

#
#    The tensor mechanics results align exactly with the analytical results above
#    when this test is run with ComputeIncrementalSmallStrain.  When the test is
#    run with ComputeFiniteStrain, a 0.05% discrepancy between the analytical
#    strains and the simulation strain results is observed, and this discrepancy
#    is carried over into the calculation of the elastic stress.
