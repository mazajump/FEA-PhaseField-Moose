# This example problem demonstrates coupling heat conduction with mechanics.
# A circular domain has as uniform heat source that increases with time
# and a fixed temperature on the outer boundary, resulting in a temperature gradient.
# This results in heterogeneous thermal expansion, where it is pinned in the center.
# Looking at the hoop stress demonstrates why fuel pellets have radial cracks
# that extend from the outer boundary to about halfway through the radius.
# The problem is run with length units of microns.
