/**
 * This class corresponds to the inviscid part of the "natural"
 * boundary condition for the momentum equations, i.e.
 *
 * int_{Gamma} n . (rho*uu + Ip) . v
 *
 * While this kernel implements the convective and pressure term
 * residuals and jacobians, it does not itself implement any of
 * the computeQp* functions.  For that, use one of the derived
 * classes:
 * 1.) NSMomentumInviscidSpecifiedPressureBC
 * 2.) NSMomentumInviscidSpecifiedNormalFlowBC
 * 3.) NSMomentumInviscidNoPressureImplicitFlowBC
 *
 * The first kernel above would be used for a subsonic outflow BC in
 * the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in which one physical value
 * (the pressure) is specified.  In this case, the residual and
 * Jacobian contrbutions of the n.(rho*u)(u.v) term are computed and
 * added to the matrix/rhs.  For the pressure term, the residual
 * contribution due to the specified pressure is computed but there is
 * no corresponding Jacobian entry since the value is given.
 *
 * The second kernel above would be used if, instead of the pressure,
 * the value of the vector (rho*u)(u.n) is given.  This situation is
 * not common, but a special case of it, u.n=0, is very common for
 * implementing a free-slip boundary: in that situation the pressure
 * is an unknown and u.n = 0 would be imposed by the kernel (though in
 * this trivial case you could omit the term completely).
 *
 * The third kernel above would be used when the pressure term
 * has *not* been integrated by parts in the momentum equations, and
 * therefore there is no pressure in the boundary term at all.
 *
 * We note that other combinations are also theoretically possible
 * (e.g. unspecified pressure and normal flow, fully-specified
 * pressure and normal flow) however they have not yet been implemented
 * since I'm not sure if they are physically-relevant.
