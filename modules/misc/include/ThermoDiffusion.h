/**
 * @brief Models thermo-diffusion (aka Soret effect, thermophoresis, etc.).
 * The mass flux J due to the thermal gradient is:
 *
 *   J_thermal = - ( D C Qstar / ( R T^2 ) ) * grad( T )
 *
 * where D is the mass diffusivity (same as for Fick's law), C is the concentration
 * Qstar is the heat of transport, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.
 * Note that that grad( T ) / T^2 == -grad( 1/T ), which is how the term
 * appears in Onsager's symmetry (this kernel works just as well for that form).
 *
 * Also note that coupled diffusion terms like ThermoDiffusion (and Nernst,
 * Ettingshausen, Dufour effects) can cause non-physical stability issues if a
 * regular diffusion term is not included. Thus, ThermoDiffusion should always
 * appear with a Fick's Law kernel such as CoefDiffusion.
 *
 * The only restriction on the units of C, Qstar, and R is that they should be
 * consistent with each other and with C and T (could be mass ppm, mols/m^3, etc.).
 *
 * This kernel applies to the concentration C, but the off-diagonal terms in the
 * Jacobian that are due to temperature dependence are also available.
