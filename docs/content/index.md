        Reliability

      <p class="left-align light">
        Within MOOSE code reliability is paramount, so it employs a
        rigorous and well-documented development strategy.
        In order to accomplish this task, a comprehensive set of
        tools for testing and documenting are continouly being developed
        and included within the framework for use by application developers.
      </p>
      <p class="left-align light">
        In particular, testing of both MOOSE and
        MOOSE-based applications is of primary importance; changes are
        only merged into the framework once manual code review and
        the automated tests have ensured the changes are compatible
        with the applications. Since MOOSE is an open-source
        project, the testing process is publicly available at
        <a href="http://www.moosebuild.org">
