# EBSDReader

!description /UserObjects/EBSDReader

The EBSDReader user object reads in data from [electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_backscatter_diffraction)
to set initial conditions for phase field simulations. EBSD identifies the grain and
phase structure of a sample, as well as the crystal structure and the crystal orientation.
The `EBSDReader` reads in this information from a specially formatted data file and
reconstructs the microstructure. It accomplishes this by setting the initial conditions
for all the phase field variables. In addition, it stores the crystal structure and
orientation information by use by the phase field and mechanics models.

**Note that the EBSDReader does not mesh the microstructure**, but rather sets phase
field variable initial conditions. To reconstruct a mesh of the microstructure,
we recommend using [OOF](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/).

# EBSD Data File Format

The `EBSDReader` user object reads in a data file taken from EBSD data. The file
should have the following format:

```
# Header:    Marmot Input File
# Date:      19-Jul-2013 00:23:55
#
# Column 1:  Euler angle "phi1" (in radians)
# Column 2:  Euler angle "PHI" (in radians)
# Column 3:  Euler angle "phi2" (in radians)
# Column 4:  x-coordinate (in microns)
# Column 5:  y-coordinate (in microns)
# Column 6:  z-coordinate (in microns)
# Column 7:  grain number (integer)
# Column 8:  phase number (integer)
# Column 9:  symmetry class (from TSL)
#
# Phase 1:   Nickel (symmetry class = 43)
# Number of Grains in Phase 1:  111
#
# X_Min:      0.000000
# X_Max:      32.000000
# X_step:     0.250000
# X_Dim:      128
#
# Y_Min:      0.000000
# Y_Max:      32.000000
# Y_step:     0.250000
# Y_Dim:      128
#
# Z_Min:      0.000000
# Z_Max:      0.000000
# Z_step:     0.000000
# Z_Dim:      0

2.48663 1.84098 5.50548 0.12500 0.12500 0.00000 0 1 43

```

The open source code [Dream3D](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/) has the option to
output in this format using the _"Write INL File"_ filter. Note that the data must
be on a square grid rather than a hex grid.

The `EBSDReader` supports additional custom data columns.
