# LevelSetOlssonBubbleFunction
\citet{olsson2005conservative} define a level set function ($\Phi$) that differs from the traditional signed distance function. They define a level set function ranging from 0 to 1 with a defined thickness ($\epsilon$), which is a commonly referred to as a smeared Heaviside function ($H_{sm}(\Phi)$):

$$ \begin{equation} H_{sm}(\Phi) = \begin{cases} 0, & \Phi < -\epsilon, \ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\Phi}{2\epsilon} + \frac{1}{2\pi}\sin(\frac{\pi\Phi}{\epsilon}), & -\epsilon \le \Phi \le \epsilon,\ 1, & \Phi > \epsilon. \end{cases} \end{equation} $$

Typically, the interface of the level set function is defined by the 0.5 contour and the interface or boundary layer is defined between 0 and 1.

For example, the following code creates a "bubble" in the lower left corner in a domain ranging from 0 to 1 in the x- and y-direction, as shown in the figure.
