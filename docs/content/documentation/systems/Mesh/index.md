# Mesh System

## Overview
In general, MOOSE is not designed for generating finite element meshes. Generally, [CUBIT](https://cubit.sandia.gov/)
from [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov/) is recommended for creating meshes, especially complex geometries,
for use in MOOSE. CUBIT can be licensed from CSimSoft for a fee depending that varies based on the type of organization
and work being performed. Other mesh generators can work as long as they output a file format that is supported by
the [FileMesh](framework/FileMesh.md) object.

## Example Syntax and Mesh Objects
Mesh settings are applied with the `[Mesh]` of the input files, for example the basic input file syntax for reading
a file from a mesh is shown below. For additional information on the other types of Mesh objects refer to the
individual object pages listed below.

## Common Input Parameters
The following is a complete list of input file parameters that may be applied to all types of mesh objects.

## Named Entity Support

Human-readable names can be assigned to blocks, sidesets, and nodesets. These names will be automatically read in and
can be used throughout the input file. Mesh generators such as CUBIT will generally provide the capability internally.
Any parameter that takes entity IDs in the input file will accept either numbers or "names". Names can also be
assigned to IDs on-the-fly in existing meshes to ease input file maintenance (see example). On-the-fly names will
also be written to Exodus/XDA/XDR files. An illustration for mesh in exodus file format.

## Replicated and Distributed Mesh

The core of the mesh capabilities are derived from [libMesh](http://libmesh.github.io), which has two underlying
parallel mesh formats: "replicated" and "distributed".

The replicated mesh format is the default format for MOOSE and is the most appropriate format to utilize for nearly
all simulations. In parallel, the replicated format copies the complete mesh to all processors allowing for efficient
access to the geometry elements.

The distributed mesh format is useful when the mesh data structure dominates memory usage. Only the pieces of the
mesh "owned" by a processor are actually stored on the processor. If the mesh is too large to read in on a single
processor, it can be split prior to the simulation.

!!! note
    Both the "replicated" and "distributed" mesh formats are parallel with respect to the execution of the finite
    element assembly and solve. In both types the solution data is distributed, which is the portion of the simulation
    that usually dominates memory demands.

## Displaced Mesh

Calculations can take place in either the initial mesh configuration or, when requested, the "displaced"
configuration. To enable displacements, provide a vector of displacement variable names for each spatial dimension in
the 'displacements' parameters within the Mesh block.

Once enabled, the any object that should operate on the displaced configuration should set the "use_displaced_mesh" to
true. For example, the following snippet enables the computation of a [Postprocessor](/Postprocessors/index.md)
with and without the displaced configuration.
