# EBSDMesh
!description /Mesh/EBSDMesh

The mesh is generated from the EBSD information, to get an optimal reconstruction
of the data. This is accomplished in the mesh block using the EBSDMesh type. The
same data file used with the EBSD reader is used in the EBSDReader UserObject.
The mesh is created with one node per data point in the EBSD data file. If you
wish to use mesh adaptivity and allow the mesh to get coarser during the simulation,
the ```uniform_refine``` parameter is used to set how many times the mesh can be
coarsened. For this to work the number of elements along _each_ dimension has to
be divisible by $2^u$ where $u$ is the value of the ```uniform_refine``` parameter.

!!! warning "```uniform_refine``` parameter"
    Contrary to other mesh objects the ```uniform_refine``` parameter will not
    affect the resolution of the final mesh. It sets the levels of coarsening
    that can be applied to the EBSD data.
