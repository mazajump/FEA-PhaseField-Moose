# PiecewiseLinearInterpolationMaterial
!description /Materials/PiecewiseLinearInterpolationMaterial

This model computes a material property using a piecewise linear interpolation to define the dependence of the property on a specified variable.  The property is computed as $f(x)$ using the piecewise linear interpolation, where the coupled variable provides the value of $x$ at each location where this is evaluated.
