# DerivativeSumMaterial
!description /Materials/DerivativeSumMaterial

This material generates new material properties that sum up the values and derivatives of a specified set of function materials. Using `args` argument the union of all sets of dependent variables has to be specified so that the `DerivativeSumMaterial` can gather the necessary derivatives to sum up.
