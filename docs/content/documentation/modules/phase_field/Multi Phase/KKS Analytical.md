In the KKS model, an analytical solution exists for the order parameter $\eta$
and composition $c$ through a 1D equilibrium interface:

$$
\eta_0(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[1-\tanh{\left( \frac{\sqrt{w}}{\sqrt{2} \epsilon} x\right)} \right]
$$

$$
c_0(x) =  h(\eta_0(x))c_S^e + [1-h(\eta_0(x))]c_L^e
$$

where we use the switching function $h(\eta) = \eta^3(6\eta^2-15\eta+10)$, the
gradient energy coefficient $\epsilon^2 = 1$ and the barrier function height $w=1$.
(Note that there is a typo in Eq. (49) of \cite{kim_phase-field_1999}, $\epsilon$ should be in the
denominator of the argument to the $\tanh$ function, not $\sqrt{\epsilon}$.) In
the following example, we equilibrate a flat interface between a solid phase
($\eta = 1$, $f^S = (c_S-c_S^e)^2$, $c_S^e = 0.9$) and a liquid phase
($\eta = 0$, $f^L = (c_L-c_L^e)^2$, $c_L^e = 0.1$) in a 2D simulation. The vector
postprocessor `LineValueSampler` is used to obtain the values of $\eta$ and $c$
along $y=0$, the results are output to a CSV file, and plotted together with the
1D analytical solution. (We will use no-flux boundary conditions, so a boundary
conditions block is not required in the input file.)

# Verification against analytical solution

To perform a more quantitative comparison of the simulation results to the analytical
solution, we will calculate the $L^2$ norm of the difference between the simulation
result and the analytical solution. The $L^2$ norm is defined for this case as

$$
\left|u - u_h\right|_{L^2} = \left( \int_\Omega (u - u_h)^2 d\Omega \right)^{1/2}
$$

where $u$ is the analytical solution, $u_h$ is the equilibrium solution from
simulation, and $\Omega$ is the domain. The $L^2$ norm can be obtained in the
MOOSE framework using the [`ElementL2Error`](Postprocessors/framework/ElementL2Error.md) postprocessor. It can be shown from
the properties of the finite element method that for the linear Lagrange elements
used in the split formulation,

$$
|u - u_h|_{L^2} \le Ch^2
$$

where $h$ is the characteristic element size (for 2D square elements, $h$ is the
length of one side) and $C$ is a constant specific to the problem. Thus, as the
mesh is refined, $L^2$ error should decrease (at least) quadratically with $h$.

In performing this comparison between the analytical solution and simulation results,
if a no-flux boundary condition is used in the simulation, the order parameter and
composition profiles may shift slightly in the $+x$ or $-x$ direction, even if the
analytical solution is used as an initial condition. This makes it difficult to
compare to an analytical solution centered at $x=0$. Therefore, we simulate the
$x \ge 0$ half of the domain and use a Dirichlet boundary condition of $\eta=0.5$
and $c=0.5$ at $x=0$, which prevents the interface from moving. For the verification,
the size of the domain was also reduced to lower the computational cost.

To verify that $L^2$ error decreases quadratically with $h$, see the plot showing
$L^2$ error versus $h$ for $\eta$ in this problem. As expected, on a log-log scale,
the points are fit well by a straight line. The slope was determined to be 1.995,
in good agreement with the expected value of 2.
