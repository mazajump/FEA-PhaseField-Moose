* [Systems](phase_field/systems.md)

The MOOSE phase field module is a library for simplifying the implementation of simulation tools that employ the phase field model. Multiphysics capability that includes mechanics and heat conduction can be obtained by employing the _tensor mechanics_ and _heat conduction_ modules. More information about this module is found below:

## Multiple Phase Models
MOOSE provides capabilities that enable the easy development of multiphase field model. A free energy expression has to be provided for each individual phase. Different systems exist to combine those _phase free energies_ into a _global free energy_.
