# Solving Phase Field Models

Once you have developed a phase field model using implicit time integration, you
need to solve your system of nonlinear equations using MOOSE. MOOSE uses the
[PETSc package](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/) to solve the equations,
therefore PETSc options that we have found to work well for phase field modeling
are provided here.

## Solution Methods

Three solve methods are available in MOOSE, which are set in the [Executioner](Executioner/index.md)
block using the _solve_type_ parameter, where the three possible options are:

* `NEWTON` - Direct solution of the system of equations using Newton's method.
  The full and accurate Jacobian is required. Thus, the [Preconditioner](Preconditioning/index.md)
  block must be employed for systems with multiple nonlinear variables.
* `JFNK` - The system is solved using Jacobian Free Newton Krylov (JFNK), so no
  Jacobian terms are needed. However, JFNK often does not perform well without
  preconditioning.
* `PJFNK` - The system is solved using preconditioned JFNK. The Jacobian is used
  to precondition the matrix, but it does not have to be fully correct and can
  neglect off-diagonal terms.

# Preconditioning Options

When using NEWTON or PJFNK, PETSc is used to manipulate the Jacobian/preconditioner
matrix. The method used for this manipulation is defined using PETSc options in
the Executioner block. Determining the optimal approach can be difficult, but we
have identified certain options that work well for phase field problems. They are
summarized below:

### LU
This uses LU decomposition to directly apply the inverse of the Jacobian matrix.
It is typically the most accurate approach, but is expensive and only works on
one processor. It is often a good debugging tool. Typical options in the block are

```
  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type'
  petsc_options_value = 'lu'
```

### ASM
The Additive Schwartz Method (ASM), is a domain decomposition method. It works
well for most models, and is the only method that works well with the split
Cahn-Hilliard equations. Increasing the `-pc_asm_overlap` improves performance
but increases the computational expense. Typical options are

```
  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -ksp_grmres_restart -sub_ksp_type -sub_pc_type -pc_asm_overlap'
  petsc_options_value = 'asm      31                  preonly       lu           2'
```

#### ASM/ILU
The incomplete factorization method (ILU) allows specifying a fill factor using
`-pc_factor_levels` increasing this can improve the preconditioner.

### BoomerAMG
BoomerAMG is the Hypre implementation of the Algebraic MultiGrid Method. It works
well for solving the Allen-Cahn equation and the direct solution of the Cahn-Hilliard
method. It has horrible performance with solving the split Cahn-Hilliard equations.
Common options are

```
  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type -pc_hypre_type -ksp_gmres_restart -pc_hypre_boomeramg_strong_threshold'
  petsc_options_value = 'hypre    boomeramg      31                 0.7'
```
