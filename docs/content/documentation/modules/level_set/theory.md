# Level Set Module Theory
## Introduction
The level set method is commonly used for front tracking problems \cite{osher2006level}. It
is modeled with the multi-dimensional advection equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:pure_advection}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla u = 0,
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time, $\vec{v}$ is a known velocity field, and $u$ is the
variable representing the interface. Traditionally $u$ is taken to be
the signed distance from the interface.  This problem poses
significant challenges: numerical stabilization techniques must be
employed to avoid node-to-node oscillations, and intermediate
re-initialization steps must be undertaken to evolve the interface in
a physically-consistent manner.

The basic requirements for solving the level set equation in MOOSE are
summarized in the following milestone objectives:

* Solve the level set equation numerically using the Galerkin finite element method.
* Apply a standard stabilization scheme.
* Implement a basic re-initialization scheme.

In order to test and demonstrate the use of the level set module, a benchmark
rotating bubble problem requiring each of the three aforementioned
components was undertaken.

## Weak Form

The weak form of \eqref{eqn:pure_advection} is: find $u_h \approx u$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:pure_advection_weak}
  \left(\frac{\partial u_h}{\partial t}, \psi_i\right) + (\vec{v} \cdot \nabla u_h, \psi_i) = 0
\end{equation}
holds for all admissible test functions, $\psi_i$.  Here $u_h$ is the
finite element approximation to $u$, and we have employed the
inner-product notation $(u,v) \equiv \int_{\Omega} uv \;\text{d}x$ for
convenience.  Solving \eqref{eqn:pure_advection_weak} in MOOSE
requires the addition of a single physics kernel for the second term
on the left-hand side of \eqref{eqn:pure_advection_weak}. This kernel
is included in the level set module as \texttt{LevelSetAdvection}, and
allows one to use coupled variables to represent the velocity field.

## Stabilization

As with any pure convection equation, implementing the level set
equation with the Galerkin finite element method requires numerical
stabilization if node-to-node oscillations are to be avoided and
standard solution accuracy is to be maintained.  The level set module also
includes kernels which implement the Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin
(SUPG) stabilization method \cite{brooks1982streamline,donea2003finite}
for \eqref{eqn:pure_advection_weak}, which is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:supg}
  \left(\frac{\partial u_h}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla u_h, \psi_i + \frac{h}{2\|\vec{v}\|}(\vec{v} \cdot \nabla\psi_i)\right) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the element length, and $\|\vec{v}\|$ is the Euclidean
norm of the velocity vector.  We note that the $h$-dependent terms add
stability to the numerical scheme by introducing the
symmetric, velocity-dependent artificial viscosity contribution:
\begin{align}
  \left(\frac{h}{2\|\vec{v}\|} \vec{v}\cdot\nabla u_h, \vec{v} \cdot \nabla\psi_i \right)
\end{align}
in a so-called "consistent" manner.  That is, if the true solution
$u$ satisfies \eqref{eqn:pure_advection}, it is easy to see, by
inspection, that it will also satisfy \eqref{eqn:supg}, since the
strong form of the residual appears in the first ``slot'' of the
inner product.  The stabilization terms are implemented in the code as
two additional [kernels](systems/Kernels/index.md): [LevelSetTimeDerivativeSUPG](level_set/LevelSetTimeDerivativeSUPG.md) and
[LevelSetAdvectionSUPG](level_set/LevelSetAdvectionSUPG.md).

## Reinitialization

The advected variable $u$ is often used to track a moving front, and
therefore it is desirable that the total amount of $u$ present in
$\Omega$ remain the same throughout the simulation.  This is
equivalent to stating that the area within a given contour of $u$
does not change. It is also frequently desirable that $u$ remain a
signed distance function throughout the course of the simulation.
There is a vast amount of research into methods which guarantee either
conservation, the signed distance property, or both.  The level set
module in MOOSE currently implements a conservative
"re-initialization" algorithm that transforms $u_h$ into a smooth
function in the range $[0, 1]$ rather than a signed distance, which is
useful for certain types of problems such as phase identification.

The weak form of the re-initialization equation is: find $U_h$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:reinit_weak}
  \left(\frac{\partial U_h}{\partial \tau}, \psi_i\right) + \left(\nabla\psi_i, (-f + \epsilon\nabla U_h\cdot\hat{n}_{\ast})\hat{n}_{\ast}\right) = 0,
\end{equation}
holds for every admissible $\psi_i$, where $\tau$ is the pseudo time
during the re-initialization, $\hat{n}_{\ast}$ is the normal vector
computed from the level set variable $u_h$ at pseudo time $\tau=0$,
$\epsilon$ is the interface thickness, $f\equiv U_h(1-U_h)$, and
$U_h(\tau=0) = u_h$. Steady-state for $U_h$ is detected when
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:steady_state}
  \frac{\|U_h^{m+1} - U_h^{m}\|}{\Delta\tau} < \delta,
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is a problem-dependent tolerance, and $U_h^m \equiv
U_h(\tau=m\Delta \tau)$.  When steady-state is achieved, $u_h$ is set
equal to the re-initialized solution $U_h$, and the entire process
is repeated at time $t+\Delta t$.
