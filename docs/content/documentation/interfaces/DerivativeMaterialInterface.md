In model development, in particular using the finite element method, it is often convenient to encapsulate expression values _together with their derivatives_. The derivatives are often needed to compute Jacobian matrix entries.

In MOOSE we use material properties to provide values for expressions that can be directly computed from variables in the solve. To store the derivatives of these material properties with respect to the variables they depend on we also use material properties. We use a standardized naming scheme to name the material property derivatives. The derivative of a material property `F` with respect to a variable `c` would be named `dF/dc`.

To enforce this naming scheme we provide the ```DerivativeMaterialInterface```, a _veneer_ template that provides methods to _declare_ and _get_ material properties that are derivatives of other material properties.

The ```DerivativeMaterialInterface``` is utilized by inheriting from it and supplying the original parent class as a template argument.

# Examples

The  can be used from Materials (to declare and get material property derivatives) or from Kernels (to get material property derivatives).

## Use in a Material class

### Header
```c++
#include "DerivativeMaterialInterface.h"
#include "Material.h"

//...

// we template the interface on 'Material'
class MyMaterial : public DerivativeMaterialInterface<Material>
{

//...

private:
  MaterialProperty<Real> & F;
  MaterialProperty<Real> & dFdc;
  MaterialProperty<Real> & d2Fdc2;
};
```

Note that it is possible to template the interface on arbitrary classes, including classes derived from ```Material``` or ```Kernel```.

### Implementation
```c++
#include "MyMaterial.h"

//...

MyMaterial::MyMaterial(const InputParameters & parameters) :
    DerivativeMaterialInterface<Material>(parameters),
    // get the c variable value, number, and name
    _c(coupledValue("c")),
    _c_var(coupled("c")),
    _c_name(getVar("c", 0)->name()),
    // declare material property and first and second derivative w.r.t. c
    F(declareProperty<Real>("F")),
    dFdc(declarePropertyDerivative<Real>("F", _c_name))
    d2Fdc2(declarePropertyDerivative<Real>("F", _c_name, _c_name))
{
}
```

Material property derivatives do _not_ need to be declared or computed in the same Material as their corresponding undifferentiated properties (though oftentimes it is a natural choice that provides encapsulation).

## Use in a Kernel class

### Header
```c++
#include "DerivativeMaterialInterface.h"
#include "Kernel.h"

//...

// we template the interface on 'Kernel'
class MyKernel : public DerivativeMaterialInterface<Kernel>
{

//...

protected:
  const MaterialProperty<Real> & F;
  const MaterialProperty<Real> & dFdc;
};
```

Note that material property derivatives that are fetched (and _not_ declared) in a class need to be stored in ```const``` references. It is recommended to use constant references for regular material properties as well, if they are not written to.

### Implementation
```c++
#include "MyKernel.h"

//...

MyKernel::MyKernel(const InputParameters & parameters) :
    DerivativeMaterialInterface<Kernel>(parameters),
    // get the c variable value, number, and name
    _c(coupledValue("c")),
    _c_var(coupled("c")),
    _c_name(getVar("c", 0)->name()),
    // fetch material property and first derivative w.r.t. c
    F(getMaterialProperty<Real>("F")),
    dFdc(getMaterialPropertyDerivative<Real>("F", _c_name))
{
}
```

Here we may also request other derivatives, such as

```
  // get the eta variable value, number, and name
  _eta(coupledValue("eta")),
  _eta_var(coupled("eta")),
  _eta_name(getVar("eta", 0)->name()),
  // fetch material property and first derivative w.r.t. eta
  dFdeta(getMaterialPropertyDerivative<Real>("F", _eta_name))
```

The _eta_ derivative may not necessarily be declared anywhere in the simulation. The interface will return a default value of zero in that case (see below).

# Default values

When requesting non-existing material property derivatives using any of the ```getMaterialPropertyDerivative``` methods, a _zero_ object will be returned. For ```Real``` types this will be `0` for vectors and tensors those will be objects with zeroes in all entries.

Knowing this, kernels utilizing the derivatives should always implement the most complete expressions including all possible derivatives, even though they might not be provided in every simulation.
